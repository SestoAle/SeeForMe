# SeeForMe
A mobile App for the automatic recognition of museum artworks and the semi-automatic management of multimedia feedback.

The project aims to realize a prototype of a **smart-interface** for a musuem audio-guide. The app is based on an 
automatic recognition system previously created but not yet imported in Java that uses machine-learning to recognize artworks and people.

The app:
* can recognize museum artworks;
* can automatically understand the context: people occlusion, distance and *importance* of artworks;
* can create multimedia cards of the visited artworks;
* can offer semi-automatic control of multimedia feedbacks.

## Interface
Here are some examples of the interface of the prototype:
